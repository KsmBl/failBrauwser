/// <summary>
/// eXpressor (CGSoftLabs) — a Win32 PE packer that stores the victim's sections as a
/// chain of raw LZMA1 streams in a single payload section.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The container has no published specification; the layout below was read off the packed
/// samples. It is self-describing, which is what makes it recoverable without interpreting
/// the loader stub:
/// </para>
/// <list type="number">
///   <item>One section holds the whole payload. It is a back-to-back chain of raw LZMA1
///     streams, one per compressed section of the original image, laid out in the original's
///     section order.</item>
///   <item>Every stream starts with the LZMA SDK's five-byte properties header — the packed
///     <c>(pb·5 + lp)·9 + lc</c> byte followed by a little-endian dictionary size. The samples
///     surveyed all carry <c>0x5E</c> (lc = 4, lp = 0, pb = 2) and an 8 MiB dictionary, but the
///     header is read rather than assumed.</item>
///   <item>Each stream is terminated by an LZMA end-of-stream marker instead of a stored
///     length, so decoding one stream also finds where the next one begins.</item>
/// </list>
/// <para>
/// Before compressing, eXpressor also runs the LZMA SDK's x86 branch filter over every section,
/// which rewrites <c>E8</c>/<c>E9</c> call and jump displacements from relative to absolute.
/// Decompression therefore yields each original section with its branch targets still in absolute
/// form; only a stream that contained no convertible site at all comes back byte-identical, which
/// over the reference corpus is 73 of 359 streams. Inverting that filter is not implemented here — see the
/// <see cref="ExecutableDiagnosticCode.TransformNotReversible"/> diagnostic every result
/// carries — so the artifacts are published as what they demonstrably are, decompressed but
/// still branch-filtered, rather than being passed off as the original bytes.
