/// Builds Huffman code lengths from symbol weights under an explicit total order on

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Textbook Huffman construction says "repeatedly merge the two lightest nodes" but says
/// nothing about which node to pick when several are equally light. Feeding the nodes to a
/// generic priority queue therefore leaves the tree shape - and with it the code lengths and
/// every compressed byte that depends on them - at the mercy of that queue's internal
/// ordering of equal keys, which no container documents. This builder removes that freedom
/// by making the tie-break part of the algorithm.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>The total order.</b> Every node carries a weight and a rank:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
///   <item><description>a leaf for symbol <c>s</c> has the weight of <c>s</c> and rank <c>s</c>;</description></item>
///   <item><description>the <c>k</c>-th internal node created (<c>k</c> counting from zero) has the
///     summed weight of its two children and rank <c>symbolCount + k</c>.</description></item>
/// </list>
/// <para>
/// Node <c>a</c> precedes node <c>b</c> exactly when <c>a.Weight &lt; b.Weight</c>, or the weights
/// are equal and <c>a.Rank &lt; b.Rank</c>. Ranks are pairwise distinct - symbols are distinct and
/// all below <c>symbolCount</c>, creation indices are distinct and all at or above it - so no two
/// distinct nodes ever compare equal and the order is total. In plain terms: lighter first;
/// among equal weights, leaves before internal nodes, leaves by ascending symbol value,
/// internal nodes oldest first. Preferring leaves on a tie also keeps the tree shallow, since
/// a leaf can never be deeper than a node that already has children.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>The construction.</b> No heap is involved. Leaves are sorted once into the above
/// order; internal nodes are appended to a second queue as they are created, and that queue is
/// already sorted, because merge weights are non-decreasing and creation indices increase. The
/// globally smallest node is therefore always at the front of one of the two queues, and
/// building the tree is an ordinary two-queue merge.
