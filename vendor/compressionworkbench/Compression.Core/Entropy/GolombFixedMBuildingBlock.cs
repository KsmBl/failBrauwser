/// Golomb/Rice coding with a pinned parameter — the fixed-M bit-stream profile.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The value coding is exactly the one <see cref="GolombBuildingBlock"/> uses: a unary
/// quotient (<c>q</c> one-bits followed by a zero-bit) then a truncated-binary remainder,
/// both written most-significant-bit first. What this block pins is the surrounding policy —
/// <see cref="GolombProfile.FixedParameter"/> with <c>M = 2</c>, and an LEB128 element count
/// instead of the four-byte little-endian one.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A constant M is the classic Golomb formulation: it is what a codec uses when the source's
/// geometric parameter is known up front (or agreed out of band) rather than measured per
/// buffer, and it removes the encoder's mean-scanning pass. Because M is a power of two here
/// the truncated-binary remainder degenerates to plain Rice coding with <c>k = 1</c>, which is
/// optimal for sources whose values are overwhelmingly 0 and 1 — residual and run-length
/// streams, for instance. On sources with a large mean it is far worse than the adaptive
/// default, since the unary prefix grows linearly with the value.
