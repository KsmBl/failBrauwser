/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This is the compression method introduced with RAR 3.x and carried through
/// RAR 4.x: LZ77 matches with four repeat-offset slots, coded through four
/// adaptive Huffman tables (main 299, distance 60, low-distance 17, repeat-length 28)
/// whose code lengths are delta-coded between blocks. It is a different algorithm
/// from the RAR5 method exposed by <see cref="RarBuildingBlock"/>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The RAR3 bitstream also admits a PPMd (PPMII variant H) mode and the VM-based
/// data filters; <see cref="Rar3Decoder"/> handles both on the decode side, but
/// only <see cref="Rar3Encoder"/>'s LZ+Huffman mode has an encoder, so this block
/// is scoped to exactly that pair. The RAR1 and RAR2 methods
/// (<see cref="Rar1Decoder"/>, <see cref="Rar2Decoder"/>) are decode-only and are
/// therefore not exposed as building blocks.
