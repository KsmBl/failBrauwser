/// <summary>
/// A software player for Impulse Tracker (<c>.it</c>) modules that renders the song to interleaved
/// stereo 16-bit PCM.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Implements the IT playback model from ITTECH.TXT (Jeffrey Lim): instrument vs. sample mode
/// (header flag 0x04), New Note Actions with a virtual-channel pool (capped at 64 background
/// voices), duplicate-check type/action, volume/panning/pitch envelopes with node ticks, the
/// resonant low-pass filter (<c>Zxx</c> and filter envelopes), and effects A..Z including the
/// S-command family. Old/new effect compatibility (flags 0x10 / 0x20) is honoured where it changes
/// semantics: with "old effects" set, <c>Gxx</c> (tone porta) and <c>Exx/Fxx</c> share memory
/// differently and vibrato runs at half depth — documented at the use sites.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Pragmatic scope: nearest-neighbour sample interpolation, additive mixing; the
/// <c>S9x</c> sound-control subset (surround/reverb/etc.) is parsed but ignored aside from S91
/// (surround) which maps to centre panning; MIDI macros are not implemented.
