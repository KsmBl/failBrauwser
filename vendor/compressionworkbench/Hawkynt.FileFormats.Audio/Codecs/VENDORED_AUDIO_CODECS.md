# Vendored managed audio codec sources

The audio codec projects compile the following source copies directly. They are not NuGet, native, runtime, submodule, or build-time dependencies.

| Codec | Source | Pinned revision | License | Local path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Opus | `lostromb/concentus` | `3885c4e46513ef0fc81fca100189e54f1714c6ca` | BSD-3-Clause | `Codec.Opus/Vendored/Concentus/` |
| Vorbis | `SteveLillis/.NET-Ogg-Vorbis-Encoder` | `9211018f92f09cff58bb0e98e3af322e83c48f3c` | MIT | `Codec.Vorbis/Vendored/OggVorbisEncoder/` |
| MP3 | `jongoochgithub/GroovyCodecs` | `007bb4fc160180ad0af2cf8b1566250677c801f1` | LGPL-3.0 | `Codec.Mp3/Vendored/GroovyCodecs/` |
| AMR-WB | `PhrSite/SipLib` | `297c28be53f97b36e6acc73c56d7b1251b5b25f4` | BSD-3-Clause | `Codec.AmrWb/Vendored/AmrWbLib/` |

All four licences permit redistribution under this repository's
`LGPL-3.0-or-later`: three are permissive (BSD-3-Clause, MIT) and GroovyCodecs
is already LGPL-3.0. Each copy keeps its upstream `LICENSE.txt` beside it.

## Local modifications

Only one, and it exists so the copies stay fully managed:

- `Concentus/ResamplerFactory.cs` and `Concentus/Opus/Structs/OpusEncoder.cs`
  lose their `using Concentus.Native;`. The upstream `Concentus.Native`
  subtree is P/Invoke to a native Opus library and is deliberately not
  vendored; neither file uses anything from it.

Nothing else is edited. The repository compiles warnings as errors with
nullable reference types on, and upstream predates both; rather than rewrite
some 1800 sites and fork the copies from the revision they claim to be, those
diagnostics are scoped off for `Hawkynt.FileFormats.Audio/Codecs/Codec.*/Vendored/**`
in `.editorconfig`.

The copies retain their upstream notices. Integration code belongs to the corresponding `Codec.*` project and uses the repository-wide .NET 10 / C# 14 build settings. Package references to these codec implementations are intentionally absent.
