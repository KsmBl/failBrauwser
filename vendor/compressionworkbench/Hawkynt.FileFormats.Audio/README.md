> Pure-managed audio handling for .NET, on top of `Hawkynt.Compression.Core`. The package claims the
> WHOLE domain — every codec, container, tracker/chiptune format and game-audio format — not a
> selection of it. Where a format is missing or only partly supported that is a tracked gap, and the
> support matrix below is the single place it is tracked.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
dotnet add package Hawkynt.FileFormats.Audio
```

The package bundles the audio-domain `Codec.*` and `FileFormat.*` assemblies while taking `Hawkynt.Compression.Core` as the shared NuGet dependency.

## ✨ Features

- PCM, companded PCM, ADPCM, speech, lossless, and lossy codec implementations in managed C#.
- Common audio containers including WAV, AIFF, AU, FLAC, Ogg, MP3, MIDI, and WavPack.
- Tracker/module and chiptune support, including MOD/S3M/XM/IT and PSF-family workflows.
- Game-audio container support such as Wwise, FMOD, AWB, and AKB families.
- Pseudo-archive view of carried data: streams, tracks, channels, tags, samples, patterns, and instruments can be surfaced as independently addressable entries where the format permits it.
- Multi-channel PCM helpers with speaker-aware channel splitting and re-interleaving.

## 🧩 Support matrix

This is the whole support ledger for the audio domain — every codec, container, tracker/chiptune
and game-audio format the package bundles, with what it can actually do. There is no second copy
of it anywhere in the repository; `Compression.Tests/Documentation/AudioReadmeStateTests.cs`
re-derives the container rows from the built registry, so a capability cannot be claimed here
without the code backing it.

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **R** | Read/decode only. |
| **WORM** | Read plus create a fresh container/output; no in-place mutation. |
| **R/W** | Encode/decode, or read/write container semantics. |
| **⚠️** | Deliberate subset; the row says which. |
| ✅ / — | Capability present / absent, re-derived from the registry. |

**Oracle** names what the row has been held against that was not written here: a published
specification, the format's own reference tool, or libavcodec through `ffmpeg`. Encoding with our
encoder and decoding with our decoder proves only that the two halves agree with each other —
WavPack, TTA, ALAC and CRI ADX each round-tripped perfectly for months while exchanging a file
with nothing else. A dash means no such check exists and the row rests on a round trip alone,
which is the single most useful thing this column has to say. Authority runs in that order too:
where our G.726 and ffmpeg disagree, the ITU-T reference decides, and it decided against ffmpeg.

### Codec support

One row per bundled `Codec.*` assembly. **Historical identifiers** lists the WAVE/ACM format
tags and other registrations that name this codec; where a tag is recognised but not yet wired
to the WAVE reader the note says so rather than leaving it implied.

Absence of an encoder is not hidden behind the word "support": a codec is `R` unless it
actually has an encode path.

### Container and music-format support

One row per registered audio-domain format. **State**, **Decode**, **Encode**, **Demux** and
**Mux** are re-derived from `FormatRegistry` and `AudioConversionInventory`, so they describe
the live code. *Decode*/*Encode* mean PCM in and out of the container; *Demux*/*Mux* mean
carrying an already-coded stream without re-encoding it. A format with none of the four is
still readable as a pseudo-archive — see the carried-data model below.

### Out of scope

The historical WAVE/ACM registry holds roughly 245 tags. Most are aliases, vendor
registrations or transport wrappers for a family already implemented above, and the tables
above map those onto the one codec that handles them. The families below are different: no
decoder for them exists here and none is planned, because each is a single-vendor codec with
no published bitstream and no surviving corpus to verify against. They are listed so the
absence is stated rather than left to be inferred from a missing row.

| Historical family | Representative tags |
| --- | --- |
| Roland RDAC | `0x0039` |
| Kelvin | `0x0135` |
| VSELP / Microsoft speech | `0x0004`, `0x0032`, `0x0066`, `0x0067`, `0x0082` |
| Voxware speech/music family | `0x0062`, `0x0069`-`0x007B`, `0x0081`, `0x181C` |
| Sonarc / PAC / proprietary music coders | `0x0021`, `0x0053`, `0x181E`, `0x1500` |
| APT-X / legacy studio codecs | `0x0025`, `0x0099` |
| Philips speech | `0x0098`, `0x0120`, `0x0121` |
| Qualcomm PureVoice / HalfRate | `0x0150`, `0x0151` |
| Intel Music Coder / Indeo Audio | `0x0401`, `0x0402` |
| QDesign Music | `0x0450` |
| On2 audio registrations | `0x0500`, `0x0501` |
| Olivetti / Lernout & Hauspie speech | `0x1000`-`0x1004`, `0x1100`-`0x1104` |
| Sonic Foundry / NCT lossless | `0x1971`, `0x1FC4` |
| Reserved / development registrations | `0x0000`, `0x008D`, `0x0301`-`0x0308`, `0x2500` range, `0xE708`, `0xFFFF` |

The G.729 family (`0x0044`, `0x0083`, `0x008C`, `0x0133`, `0x0134`, `0xA103` — the last two were
long mis-filed under SIPR) is a gap rather
than a decision: the algorithm is published and implementable, there is simply no
implementation here yet.

## 🚀 Quick start

```csharp
using Codec.Pcm;
using FileFormat.Wav;

var blob = File.ReadAllBytes("input.wav");
var parsed = new WavReader().Read(blob);

foreach (var (name, monoWav) in PcmCodec.SplitInterleavedPcm(
             parsed.InterleavedPcm,
             parsed.NumChannels,
             parsed.SampleRate,
             parsed.BitsPerSample))
  File.WriteAllBytes($"{name}.wav", monoWav);
```

## 📚 Carried-data model

Every audio file can be surfaced as a pseudo-archive: the container is the archive, and what it carries becomes pseudo-files.

| Entry kind | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Container` | Byte-exact original container (`FULL.<ext>`). |
| `Stream` | Carried coded elementary/logical stream. |
| `Track` | Track inside a multi-track container. |
| `Channel` | Decoded speaker channel, commonly surfaced as mono PCM WAV. |
| `Tag` | Metadata such as ID3, Vorbis comments, RIFF chunks, cover art, markers. |
| `Sample` / `Pattern` / `Instrument` | Tracker-module payloads. |

Channel naming follows explicit speaker bitmaps when present (`WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE.dwChannelMask`, CAF channel bitmap). Otherwise the channel-count mapping covers mono, stereo, 2.1, 4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, immersive 5.1.4/7.1.4/9.1.4/9.1.6 layouts, and NHK 22.2. Unknown layouts degrade to `CH_n`, so channels are not discarded. `Codec.Pcm.ChannelLayout`, `PcmCodec.SplitInterleavedPcm`, and `Interleave` provide the corresponding split/reassembly helpers.

## 🔬 Codec implementation scope

Each codec is expected to expose a decompression path appropriate to its format and metadata access where implemented; encoders exist only where the checked-in codec actually provides them. The package deliberately avoids claiming that a header parser, packet/framing layer, or stubbed spectral path equals complete decoding.

Modern codecs in particular should be read according to their source/tests:

- **MP3**: MPEG framing and decode code exist; Layer III encoding and the `0x0055` WAVE route are covered by in-tree round trips, while Layer I/II remain decode-only.
- **Vorbis**: the package contains the Vorbis decode path and Ogg integration; real-corpus interoperability evidence belongs in tests.
- **Opus**: any CELT/SILK/hybrid boundary in the checked-in decoder is a material limitation and must not be hidden by a generic green “R”.
- **AAC**: AAC-LC encode and decode are pinned against an ffmpeg-produced bitstream that exercises all four window sequences, and the RAW_AAC1 / ADTS WAVE routes ride that same path; HE-AAC/SBR and other profile boundaries remain documented subsets rather than inferred as full ISO/IEC 14496-3 coverage.

The same rule applies to every long-tail codec: unsupported branches should fail explicitly or surface coded/raw data rather than fabricate PCM.

The support matrix above is one of three separate ledgers — containers, audio
codecs and video codecs are tracked apart, because recognising a stream does not
imply decoding it. Which ledger answers which question, and the rule that an
identifier is not a codec, are in
[`docs/MEDIA-LEDGERS.md`](https://github.com/Hawkynt/CompressionWorkbench/blob/main/docs/MEDIA-LEDGERS.md).
Where the historical WAVE/ACM tags in this matrix come from, and why the
catalogue is not a to-do list, is in
[`docs/AUDIO-IDENTIFIER-REGISTRY.md`](https://github.com/Hawkynt/CompressionWorkbench/blob/main/docs/AUDIO-IDENTIFIER-REGISTRY.md).

## 🧪 Validation and interoperability

The source repository uses codec/container round trips, synthetic vectors, format-specific regressions, and external-tool/reference comparisons where suitable. Exact numeric quality results belong to tests or generated reports rather than being frozen into package marketing copy, because implementations and test corpora evolve independently of NuGet README prose.

## 🔖 Versioning

The audio package is built against the repository's shared Core version and should be consumed with a compatible `Hawkynt.Compression.Core` version. Release tooling determines the concrete package version; this README does not predict future release states.

## 📚 API reference

<!-- API:BEGIN generated by Hawkynt/RepositoryTemplate/package-readme — edit the XML docs in source, not here -->

Every public and protected member of all 1456 types, generated from the built assembly and its XML documentation, is in [REFERENCE.md](https://github.com/Hawkynt/CompressionWorkbench/blob/main/Hawkynt.FileFormats.Audio/REFERENCE.md).

## 🔌 Dependencies

| Dependency | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`Hawkynt.Compression.Core`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hawkynt.Compression.Core/) | Shared compression, bit I/O, entropy, and registry primitives. |
| Native codecs / FFmpeg | **None required by the package.** External tools may be used by tests for validation, not at runtime. |

## ⚠️ Limitations

- `R` codecs are decoders, not hidden encoders. The tables deliberately distinguish those from `R/W` implementations.
- Advanced codecs can implement named profiles/subsets; source contracts and tests are authoritative for those edges.
- The package focuses on codec/container I/O, not DSP features such as resampling, loudness normalisation, or mastering.
- Tracker/chiptune/game-audio coverage includes emulation/synthesis-oriented components whose behavior is more nuanced than a single “supports format X” flag.
- External validation or an internal round trip is evidence for the tested path, not a blanket claim over every producer/profile/version of a codec.

## 📖 References to learn from

These upstream inventories are used to audit the audio ledger for missing codecs, containers,
framing variants, and long-tail game-audio formats. They are coverage and interoperability
references, not runtime dependencies or evidence that a format is already implemented here.

- **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)** — broad codec and container reference; its
  [supported formats/codecs](https://ffmpeg.org/general.html) and
  [libavformat muxer/demuxer documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html) are used to
  find mainstream and specialist audio gaps and to provide interoperability oracles where suitable.
- **[vgmstream](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream)** — long-tail video-game audio reference;
  its [supported-format and codec inventory](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/blob/master/doc/FORMATS.md)
  is used to find game-audio gaps, companion-file cases, subsongs, loop metadata, and unusual
  container/codec combinations. For AKB specifically, [`src/meta/akb.c`](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/blob/master/src/meta/akb.c)
  pins the classic/AKB2 field layout and codec mapping while [`src/meta/sqex_streamfile.h`](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/blob/master/src/meta/sqex_streamfile.h)
  documents the sdlib `EncKey` XOR transport. vgmstream itself is decode-only, so encoder/muxer work
  requires independent format evidence rather than assuming a reverse path exists upstream.
- **[Memoria](https://github.com/Albeoris/Memoria)** — independent FFIX AKB2 writer/oracle;
  [`AKB2Header.cs`](https://github.com/Albeoris/Memoria/blob/main/Memoria.Prime/OggFile/AKB2/AKB2Header.cs)
  and [`SoundImporter.cs`](https://github.com/Albeoris/Memoria/blob/main/Assembly-CSharp/Global/Sound/Loader/SoundImporter.cs)
  pin the canonical 304-byte single-material Ogg layout and loop metadata used to cross-check the AKB2 writer.
