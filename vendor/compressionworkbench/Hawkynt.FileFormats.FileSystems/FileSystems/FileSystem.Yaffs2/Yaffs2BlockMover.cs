/// itself in its spare area — the object it belongs to, which chunk of that
/// object it is, and the sequence number that decides which copy wins — and a
/// mount finds a file by scanning for its chunks rather than by following a
/// pointer to them. So a chunk can be written anywhere the flash has room, and
/// moving one is the copy of its data and spare together with nothing to
/// repoint afterwards.</para>
///
/// <para>That is why the allocation update here does nothing but check the
/// destination is on a chunk boundary. Landing a chunk half way into another
/// would put its spare where the next chunk's data belongs, and the scan would
/// read both as rubbish.</para>
