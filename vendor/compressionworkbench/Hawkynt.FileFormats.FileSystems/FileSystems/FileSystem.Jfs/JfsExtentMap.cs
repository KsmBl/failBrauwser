/// its own header, so the walk validates that against where it expected the
/// page to be rather than assuming the layout.</para>

/// <para>The bitmap alone says which blocks are taken and nothing about by
/// whom, which is enough to wipe a volume and not enough to lay one out again:
/// a run with no owner has nothing to repoint. So each file's extents are read
/// from its xtree and reported under its name, and what the bitmap claims
