/// <para>SmartFS divides the flash into equal sectors. Every sector opens with
/// a five-byte header naming the logical sector it currently holds, which is
/// what lets the wear-levelling layer move a logical sector to a different
/// physical one without anything above noticing. A freshly formatted volume —
/// which is what this writer emits — maps logical to physical one to one.</para>
///
/// <para>Past that header, a sector that carries a chain (a directory or a
/// file) opens with a five-byte chain header: the next logical sector, how many
/// bytes of this one are used, and what kind of chain it is. A directory's
/// payload is a run of fixed-size entries; a file's payload is its bytes.</para>
