/// Writes a bcachefs volume: a superblock, the b-trees that describe the files,
/// and the files themselves.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>bcachefs keeps no directory blocks and no inode table. A file's name is a
/// key in the dirents tree, its metadata a key in the inodes tree, and its bytes
/// are named by keys in the extents tree; a volume is those trees plus a
/// superblock that says where their roots are. Because the volume is written whole
/// and never mounted for writing in between, the roots go in the superblock's
/// clean section, and no journal entries are needed to find them.</para>
///
/// <para>The allocation information is written too: the alloc tree says what each
/// bucket holds and how much of it is used, the bucket_gens tree gives every
/// bucket's generation, and the freespace tree covers the runs of buckets nothing
/// has been laid into. What each bucket holds has to agree with what the extents
/// say, and the count of b-tree buckets feeds itself — those keys are themselves
/// keys, so adding them can want another node — which is why the description is
/// settled by repetition rather than worked out once.</para>
///
/// <para>It used to be left out, and the volume claimed <c>no_alloc_info</c> and
/// <c>small_image</c> to be let past the check that would have built it. No
/// formatter sets either, so the volume could be told from one by the bits alone,
/// and a read-write mount was refused outright. Neither is claimed now.</para>
///
/// <para>The accounting tree carries the totals: how many inodes there are, and
/// per kind of content how many buckets, how many live sectors and how many
/// sectors sit unused inside used buckets. They come off the same walk as the
/// alloc keys, because they are the same facts added up, and counting them
/// separately is how the two come to disagree.</para>
///
/// <para>Accounting is the one part here the checker will not confirm. A volume
/// carrying wrong totals passes <c>fsck</c> exactly as one carrying right ones
/// does — tested, not assumed — so the numbers are held instead to a filesystem
/// <c>mkfs.bcachefs</c> made and the kernel initialised. Against that, the
/// superblock and journal rows match to the sector.</para>
///
/// <para>The backpointers tree points the other way: from a stretch of the
/// device back to what occupies it — one key per b-tree node, and one per file
/// extent. Those keys have to know
/// where each node landed, which is decided by the same rule the write pass
/// follows — trees in order, each taking as many consecutive buckets as it has
/// nodes — so the rule is applied here rather than the assignment being threaded
/// out of the writer.</para>
///
/// <para>Accounting also carries what each tree costs and what each snapshot
/// holds in it. Both are read off the trees themselves, so they cannot come to
/// describe a volume other than the one being written, and the accounting tree
/// measures itself among them.</para>
///
/// <para>The LRU tree stays empty, which is what a filesystem
/// <c>mkfs.bcachefs</c> made and the kernel initialised also has, so there is
/// nothing there to write.</para>
///
/// <para>The replicas counters say how many sectors of each kind of content
/// there are per set of devices holding a copy of it, and the superblock's
/// replicas section declares those sets. The two go together: a counter naming
/// a set the section does not declare is refused, and the volume with it. See
