  // formatted volume's $AttrDef reads back as: the 3.x table here is byte-identical to
  // the one mkfs.ntfs writes, terminating zero entry included. The 1.2 table's
  // $STANDARD_INFORMATION entry allows 48 bytes and no more, where the 3.x one allows
  // 48 to 72 — that is the rule that makes the 72-byte shape a 3.x form.
