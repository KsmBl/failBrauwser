> Pure-managed filesystem handling for .NET, without mounting anything through the host OS. The
> package claims the WHOLE domain — every filesystem and disk-image container, modern, legacy,
> virtual-machine, optical, forensic and retro-computing alike — not a selection of it. Where a
> format is read-only, create-only or a deliberate subset, that is a tracked gap recorded in the
> [support matrix](#-support-matrix) below, which is generated from the descriptors and checked by
> the test suite.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
dotnet add package Hawkynt.FileFormats.FileSystems
```

The package bundles every `FileSystem.*` assembly and the disk-image `FileFormat.*` assemblies, with `Hawkynt.Compression.Core` as its one NuGet dependency.

## ✨ Features

- Inspect filesystems in-process without `libguestfs`, loop mounts, kernel drivers or elevated privileges — NTFS from Linux, ext4 from Windows, HFS+ from either.
- Create fresh images for every format marked WORM or R/W below, with real nested directory trees where the format has them.
- Edit existing images for every format marked R/W: add, replace, remove, purge. Some formats edit blocks in place, some lay the volume out again; the matrix says which.
- Defragment, wipe unused space, shrink and re-lay volumes at a chosen geometry on the formats whose descriptors offer it.
- Open disk-image containers (VHD, VHDX, VMDK, VDI, QCOW2, DMG, EWF, optical and tape images, firmware volumes) and reach the filesystem inside.
- Every writer is held against the format's own tools where one exists: a real kernel under QEMU, its `fsck`, or its canonical third-party utility.

## 🧩 Support matrix

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **N/A** | Registered filesystem domain that is not represented by a standalone image/container descriptor; specialized multi-source drivers may expose mounted capabilities separately. |
| **R** | Open, list and extract only. For network, distributed and encrypted formats this may be signature/metadata detection; deliberately unverified descriptors can instead require explicit format selection and expose an opaque object. |
| **WORM** | Read plus create a fresh image; no supported edit of an existing image. |
| **R/W** | Read plus add / replace / remove / purge on an existing image. The edit may update blocks in place or lay the volume out again — the **Notes** column says when it is the latter. |

The six verb columns are the maintenance operations the CLI and the UI gate on, defined once in [`docs/ARCHIVE-MODEL.md`](https://github.com/Hawkynt/CompressionWorkbench/blob/main/docs/ARCHIVE-MODEL.md):

- **Defrag** lays a volume out again, and says how: *moving* relocates only the runs that are out of place through a block mover of the format's own, *rebuild* writes the volume out afresh.
- **Wipe** zeroes what no file holds — free space, cluster-tip slack, deleted directory entries — without touching a live byte.
- **Shrink** reduces a volume to what it needs, keeping its geometry. It is absent wherever the geometry is fixed: for most read-only filesystems and for optical images there is no smaller canonical size to step to, so nothing could be reclaimed.
- **Layout** re-lays a volume at a chosen cluster or block geometry. This needs a creator to write the new volume with, so a format that can only analyse its geometry is marked absent here however thoroughly it reads it.
- **Purge** erases every live entry and leaves a valid empty image.
- **Compact** is the composite the UI offers as one click: defrag, then layout, then shrink, so it is available wherever any of those three is.

**Proof** is how the format is held against something outside this repository, and every tool it names links to that tool's own source, so the thing doing the checking can be reached from here. "own reader + struct-parity tests" means nothing outside this repository currently checks the format — either no such tool exists, or none is wired into the suite — so the on-disk structures are checked field by field instead. That cell is the honest gap, and it is deliberately preferred over naming a tool nobody runs: a cell that cites a checker which never executes stops anyone from going looking for one.

The `Id`, `State` and verb columns are read off the descriptors by `FilesystemReadmeIsCurrentTests`, and cross-checked against the registry's own filesystem list by `CapabilityDocumentationTests`; a row that disagrees with the code fails the build. `FilesystemVerbsAreBackedTests` then runs each ticked verb, so a cell cannot be earned by declaring an interface that refuses when called.

<!-- SUPPORT:BEGIN generated by Compression.Tests/Documentation/FilesystemSupportMatrix.cs — Id, State and the six verb columns come from the descriptors; the other cells are kept as written -->

## 🚀 Quick start

### Walk a filesystem image

```csharp
using FileSystem.Fat;

var image = File.ReadAllBytes("disk.img");
using var fs = new FatReader(image);
foreach (var entry in fs.ListRecursive())
  Console.WriteLine($"{entry.Path} {entry.Size,10} {entry.Modified:O}");
```
### Open a virtual disk and inspect its inner filesystem

```csharp
using FileFormat.Vhd;
using FileSystem.Ntfs;

using var stream = File.OpenRead("system.vhd");
var inner = new VhdReader().OpenContents(stream);
foreach (var partition in inner.Partitions) {
  if (partition.Type != "NTFS")
    continue;
  var ntfs = new NtfsReader(partition.Open());
  foreach (var path in ntfs.WalkPaths())
    Console.WriteLine(path);
}
```

### Edit an image through the registry

```csharp
using Compression.Registry;

Compression.Lib.FormatRegistration.EnsureInitialized();
var ops = (IArchiveModifiable)FormatRegistry.GetArchiveOps("Ext")!;
using var image = File.Open("root.ext4", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.ReadWrite);
ops.Add(image, [new ArchiveInputInfo("", "etc/motd", false, "hello\n"u8.ToArray())]);
ops.Remove(image, ["var/log/old.log"]);
```

## 🧪 How the proofs run

The **Proof** column is produced by these suites, all in `Compression.Tests`. External tools that are absent make the corresponding test skip rather than fail, so the matrix records what has been shown, not what a particular runner had installed. A tool too old to read the format at all counts as absent for this purpose and skips with the version it reported — it never examined the image, so it has not judged it. A tool that does read the image and then objects has judged it, and that is a failure, never a skip.

| Suite | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `Support/ThirdPartyFsCheck` | Mounts the written image with the host kernel's own driver, or extracts it with 7-Zip, and compares every payload. A driver that is present and refuses the volume fails the test; only a driver that is absent lets it skip. |
| `Support/QemuRunner` (BSD guests) | A headless FreeBSD guest runs `fsck_ffs` over the written UFS volume; a DragonFly guest runs `hammer` over the HAMMER and HAMMER2 volumes. There is no Linux guest — Linux drivers are reached through the host kernel, not through QEMU. |
| `KernelMount/InPlaceRwKernelMountTests` | On a Linux host whose kernel carries the module, the host loop-mounts the package's image directly and reads the in-place-added file (MinixV1, MinixV2, NILFS2). Skips without sudo, `losetup` or the module. |
| `ExternalConformance*`, `ExternalFsInteropTests` (`Category("ExternalFsInterop")`) | `e2fsck`, `xfs_repair`, `btrfs check`, `fsck.f2fs`, `fsck.jfs`, `reiserfsck`, `fsck.minix`, `fsck.hfsplus`, hfsutils, ntfs-3g, `mkudffs`, `unsquashfs`, `mtools`, `qemu-img` accept what the package writes, and the package reads what they write. |
| DOS-era drivers under QEMU / `dmsdos` | MS-DOS 6.22 `DRVSPACE` mounts the DoubleSpace / DriveSpace CVFs; the `dmsdos` driver mounts the DriveSpace 3 and Stacker volumes. |
| Struct-parity unit tests | For formats with no reachable external tool, each on-disk structure the writer emits is compared field by field against the specification and read back by the package's own reader. |
Disk-image containers follow the same rule with `qemu-img`: forward `check`, raw round-trip via `convert -O raw`, and reverse — an image `qemu-img create` made is opened by the package reader. A forensic-style path builds an inner filesystem with known files, wraps it in a container, validates the container externally, then walks it back and compares bytes.

## 🧯 Filesystem-aware recovery

`FilesystemCarver` in `Compression.Analysis` scans raw images for known superblock signatures at canonical offsets, asks the matching reader to validate each candidate, and can then extract readable entries — useful when a partition table is lost but an inner superblock survives.

```csharp
using var fs = File.OpenRead("sdcard.img");
var hits = FilesystemCarver.CarveStream(fs);
foreach (var c in hits) {
  var result = FilesystemExtractor.ExtractCarved(fs, c, $"out/{c.FormatId}_0x{c.ByteOffset:X}");
  Console.WriteLine($"{c.FormatId}: {result.FilesExtracted} files, {result.FilesFailed} failed");
}
```

```text
cwb recover sdcard.img
cwb recover raw.img --mode filesystems --out out/
cwb recover raw.img --mode files --format Jpeg,Png
```

## 🔌 Dependencies

| Dependency | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`Hawkynt.Compression.Core`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hawkynt.Compression.Core/) | Compression, checksums, bit I/O, partition helpers and the shared registry primitives |
| Host filesystem drivers / `libguestfs` | **Not required at runtime.** |
| External `fsck` / `mkfs` / `qemu` tools | Optional, used by the test suite only |

## ⚠️ Limitations

- This is an image-manipulation toolkit, not a kernel filesystem driver. R/W does not imply concurrent mount semantics, crash-consistent journaling under arbitrary interruption, or a drop-in replacement for the OS driver.
- Where **Notes** says a format's edits *rebuild* the volume, an add or remove costs the whole image rather than the bytes that changed, and the block placement of untouched files may move.
- **bcachefs** mutation is profile-gated: the in-place writer owns single-device regular pointer extents as emitted by this package. Bucket generations are carried through a mutation: emptying a bucket advances its generation, and the alloc key, the `bucket_gens` slot, the extent pointer and its backpointer are written from one source and checked against each other before the commit is published. Foreign volumes with extra live b-trees, non-canonical `bucket_gens` or `alloc_v4` keys, inline / reflink / compressed extent keys, or unsupported inode and dirent types are refused for mutation rather than rewritten speculatively; read support is broader. How the accounting, backpointer and LRU keys were established is written up in [BCACHEFS-ACCOUNTING.md](https://github.com/Hawkynt/CompressionWorkbench/blob/main/docs/BCACHEFS-ACCOUNTING.md).
- **ReFS** edits are offline-quiescent: the image must not be mounted, and `RefsMutationMode.NativeCow` stays fail-closed. The reader walks ReFS 3.x containers, MSB+ trees, allocators, Block Refcount rows and MLog framing; the offline editor relocates data and metadata pages, replaces and removes regular files and empty directories through CoW B+ replacement and alternate-checkpoint publication. Block Refcount row creation and whole-file clone semantics are implemented and tested: `RefsOfflineBlockCloner.CloneWholeFile` repoints an existing destination stream at an existing, equal-sized, cluster-aligned source stream, materialises the shared-cluster reference counts — including the first clone of a slot the sparse table does not yet track — and publishes Object Table root #0 and Block Refcount root #6 through one alternate checkpoint, reclaiming the destination's former allocation only once that checkpoint is durable. Writing to a clone afterwards reallocates rather than overwriting the shared clusters. **No public verb reaches this primitive**: it is a library entry point, not something `cwb` can be asked to do, and the profile is deliberately narrower than `FSCTL_DUPLICATE_EXTENTS_TO_FILE` — resident, sparse, integrity, zero-length, already-shared and partial-range clones are all refused. Still open before a mounted driver could use the same core: redo-payload codecs and replay for every opcode, every Schema Table key rule, the allocation-zone policies of the three allocators, container create / delete / move, partial-range and EOF-extending clones, hard links, sparse and integrity-stream mutation beyond 4 KiB clusters, snapshots, ADS, security descriptors, reparse points, USN, rename, truncate, a format path, locking and a Windows `chkdsk` corpus.
- **Reiser4** remains WORM: the current writer captures the empty native tree but stores added files in a payload area the reiser4 driver does not see. It must not be promoted until the native tree writer owns those files.
- **GFS2** R/W is the standalone `lock_nolock` profile with regular files in the root directory; small files are stuffed and larger files use the indirect tree. Existing-image edits rebuild the volume while preserving its size floor and lock-table value. ExHash/nested-directory writing, journal replay, cluster-lock-manager state and extended attributes remain out of scope.
- **NSS** native read support is intentionally narrow and quiescent: the reader reconstructs validated DirH/LEAF namespace relationships and ordinary contiguous file extents using the OES-derived clean-room profile in [NSS-ON-DISK.md](https://github.com/Hawkynt/CompressionWorkbench/blob/main/docs/NSS-ON-DISK.md), while retaining anchor diagnostics for unsupported images. Native allocation trees, journals, trustee metadata, ZLBH history, compressed/sparse/fragmented data profiles and writable NSS pools remain out of scope; the existing writer still emits a private Workbench container rather than a pool NetWare/OES would mount.
- Network and distributed formats generally carry no self-contained image. eCryptfs is the encrypted exception handled here: a lower file is structurally self-contained, and the passphrase profile is supported for AES-128/192/256; private-key authentication and xattr-only metadata remain unsupported.
- Disk-image container support and inner-filesystem support are separate capabilities; a container marked R/W edits the filesystem inside it through that filesystem's own descriptor.
